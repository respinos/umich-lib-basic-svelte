<p>‘Why?’ said the Caterpillar.</p>
<p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. ‘Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought Alice; ‘only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.’</p>
<p>‘Can’t remember WHAT things?’ said the Caterpillar.</p>
<p>‘Well! WHAT are you?’ said the Pigeon. ‘I can see you’re trying to invent something!’</p>
<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>			<p style="margin-top: 2rem; text-align: center">
